## Project Overview
Mental health is a critical issue in academic environments. This study aims to:

- Assess the risk levels of depression among computer science students  
- Analyze how different demographics (**Gender** and **Academic Year**) correlate with depression risk  
- Identify external factors (financial, family, social pressure) that influence students' mental well-being  

---

## Methodology
The study utilizes a structured survey divided into three main sections:

1. **Part 1: General Information**  
   - Gender, Year of Study  

2. **Part 2: 9Q Depression Severity Test**  
   - Standardized assessment tool  

3. **Part 3: Influencing Factors**  
   - Financial issues, work stress, family problems, social pressure, etc.

## Key Findings (Summary)
- Highlights which academic years are most vulnerable to high-stress levels  
- Identifies primary triggers for mental health struggles, such as financial burdens and academic pressure  
- Provides a data-driven foundation for developing better student support systems within the department
